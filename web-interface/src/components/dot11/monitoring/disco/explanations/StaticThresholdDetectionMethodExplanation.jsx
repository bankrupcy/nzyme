      <p>
        The <strong>Static Threshold Detection</strong> method allows you to set a specific threshold. If values surpass
        this threshold, an alarm will be activated. This approach is especially valuable in environments with minimal
        traffic. Automated and dynamic anomaly detection systems may struggle in these conditions due to insufficient
        data for accurate decisions and predictions.
