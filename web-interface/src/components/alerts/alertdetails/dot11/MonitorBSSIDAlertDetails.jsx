                    An access point with an unfamiliar BSSID (hardware address) is broadcasting one of our SSIDs
                    (network name). This might be a rogue access point attempting to entice users to connect by
                    mimicking a legitimate access point from a trusted wireless network. It's worth noting that adept
                    attackers are unlikely to trigger this alert, as they would emulate a legitimate access point by
                    transmitting frames with a spoofed BSSID.
