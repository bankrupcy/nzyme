# Contributing code to nzyme

We welcome outside contributions. Here are a few things to know:

* Check with maintainers if your contribution has a chance of being merged before putting
  too much effort into it. A code change has to fit into the general product direction
  and be of high enough quality. Maintainers will be happy to discuss the proposed change
  and come up with a good approach together.
* Please include a reasonable amount of unit tests.
* The pull request will prompt you to sign the
  [nzyme CLA(https://cla-assistant.io/lennartkoopmann/nzyme) and it cannot be merged
  before that is done.
* Please create a PR for each feature, bug fix or improvement. Do not mix multiple types
  of changes into a single PR. This makes reviewing and merging much easier.
